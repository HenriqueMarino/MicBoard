#### Comments:
 - Windows can prevent the program from running, accusing it as potentially malicious, but don't worry, there is simply no digital signature. Proceed with execution as normal.

- And do not delete the DLL (s) contained in the program folder, otherwise errors will occur

- Finally, the program is still in the development process (but it is usable), if there is an error, report it immediately.
